SquadXML
========

This is a web program that can produce XML squad files and the picture links for Arma 2 and Arma 3 games while allowing the simple
changing of ranks of players by an admin. It makes the creation of individual squad XML files much easier than by hand.

To build the project you need play 2.0.4 installed, SBT 0.11.3 and java 6 or up.

Running a building can be done using `play dist`.

There is a start.bat file at the root that you may want to add to the zip if deploying on Windows.

If you want to use this program outside of Tier 1 Ops be aware you need to change the XML template,
all the images and may need to adjust the ranks in the Rank model.
